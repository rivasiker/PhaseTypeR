title = "Order statistics and multivariate discrete phase-type distributions.",
abstract = "In this thesis, we present three different topics of research which are related to the theory of phase-type distributions. Those topics are explained next. The ﬁrst research work is on order statistics from matrix-geometric distributions in the case of a sample of independent and non-identically distributed random variables. We prove that order statistics from matrix-geometric distributions are matrix-geometric distributed and we provide representations for their distributions. The second research work is a study of the discrete version of multivariate phasetype distributions introduced by V. G. Kulkarni. We give an expression for the joint probability-generating function in the similar way than in the continuous time case and under this base we make an analysis of this class of distributions and present examples that are commonly found in the literature. The third research work presented came out with the aim of relating the last two topics. That is, we found a problem which relates the concept of order statistics and multivariate phase-type distributions introduced by V. G. Kulkarni, the last in the case of continuous time. Thus, we present a research on concomitants of phase-type distributions. We provide a procedure to calculate the density function of concomitants of phase-type distributions and we prove that concomitants of phase-type distributions are phase-type distributed.",

title = "MCMC for inference on phase-type and masked system lifetime models",
abstract = "Common reliability data consist of lifetimes (of censoring information) on all components and systems under examination. However, masked system lifetime data represents an important class of problems where the information available for statistical analysis is more limited: one only has failure times for the system as a whole, but no data on the component lifetimes directly, or even which components had failed. For example, such data can arise when system autopsy is impractical or cost prohibitive.",
